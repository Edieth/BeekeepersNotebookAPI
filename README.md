# Beekeeper's notebook
Record of beekeeping activities such as feeding the bees, deworming, harvesting, inventory of materials to keep track of beekeeping activity. However, only the queen's entry date was recorded to determine her lifespan, the inventory of items, the register of hives, queens, and harvests by area for beekeepers with different apiaries, as applicable. In the hives section, the total honey harvested is shown based on the net honey data. Firebase authentication is used to verify the user and to reset the email and password.
# 🐝 Beekeepers Notebook

**Beekeepers Notebook** is a native Android mobile application developed in Kotlin, designed to help beekeepers efficiently manage and monitor their apiaries, hives, and queen bees. The application allows users to keep detailed records of inspections, inventories, and the health status of their hives.

## 📱 Key Features

*   **User Management:** Secure registration and login (Authentication).
*   **Apiary Control (Zones):** Record the geographic location (latitude/longitude), address, and details of each apiary.
*   **Inventory Management:** Control equipment, tools, and supplies.
*   **Queen Monitoring:** Tracking the age and breed of queen bees.
*   **Cloud Synchronization:** Data is stored and synchronized in real time using Firestore Database via a REST API.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Language:** [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
*   **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) / Clean Architecture Layers (Entity, Data, Interface, Controller).
*   **User Interface (UI):** XML Layouts, Material Design Components.
*   **Network and API:**
    *   [Retrofit2](https://square.github.io/retrofit/): For consuming REST services.
    *   [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson): For serializing and deserializing JSON data.
    *   OkHttp Logging Interceptor: For debugging network calls.
*   **Backend / Database:**
    *   **Firebase Authentication:** Identity management.
    *   **Firebase Firestore:** NoSQL database in the cloud.
    *   **Custom REST API:** Consumed via Retrofit (Node.js/Express).
*   **Concurrency:** `kotlinx-coroutines` for handling asynchronous operations.
*   **Jetpack Libraries:**
    *   Core KTX
    *   Lifecycle & ViewModel
    *   ConstraintLayout
    *   Activity KTX

## 📂 Project Structure

The code is organized into the following main packages:

*   `Entity`: Contains data models and DTOs (e.g., `Person`, `InventoryItem`, `DTOZone`).
*   `Data`: Data source implementations (e.g., `RestInventoryDataManager`, `RestPersonDataManager`).
*   `Interfaces`: API definitions (`InventoryApi`) and data contracts (`IDataManager`).
*   `Controller`: Business logic that connects the UI with the data (e.g., `PersonController`).
